As a team of four, we utilized C++ to create a synthesizer capable of generating a wide range of notes through keyboard input. Our synthesizer boasted advanced functionalities, including waveform selection, a user interface, stereo sound, and more. To accomplish this, we employed multithreading techniques and gained valuable insights into critical concepts like deadlock prevention, thread safety, and writing clean, object-oriented code. The full code can be found <a href="https://github.com/rkhoury18/Embedded_CW2">here</a>.
