- Throughout all my school years, I was on the Honor's List, with Top 5 ranking, every year (amongst an average of 200 students).
- Actively participated in yearly International Football competitions, representing my school in many countries and winning several awards (listed here below). I was honored to be selected as an All Star team member 3 times.                                
- Recognized by coaches as an outstanding athlete while being ambassador of the International College. I received the Cougar of the year award. 
- As part of an initiative launched by Unicef, aiming at encouraging "girls" to join the STEM field (Science, Technology and Mathematics), I was selected amongst other female students by the International College teaching body to participate in the Girls Got IT workshop and competition. I led my team to construct and program a robot, with pre-defined criteria, capable of avoiding all round collisions due to its sensors. We joined the motherboard to the motor, powered by a battery embedded in a car structure. Having constructed an efficient robot in a record time with the ability to perform all assigned tasks, I won the GGIT Award. Being the team leader, and the winner of the competition, I was appointed to be the ambassador / spokesperson detailing the experience in the video featured on the “Unicef” website and which can be found <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MUfrnvAQvT8&feature=youtu.be  ">here</a>.
