Hello! My name is Rhea Khoury, and I am currently pursuing a major in Information and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College in London. This field has provided me with countless opportunities to nurture my creativity and refine my problem-solving skills.

Since my school days, I have been deeply passionate about creating and designing innovative solutions. Whether working independently or as part of a collaborative team, I have consistently focused on developing environmentally conscious and technically advanced projects. Throughout my journey, I have also immersed myself in coding, processor development, and machine design, applying my knowledge to bring ideas to life.

Growing up in diverse and multicultural environments has greatly enriched my interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. I take pride in being an accomplished, proactive, and self-motivated problem solver, critical thinker, and communicator. Fluent in English, French, and Arabic, I have the ability to connect with individuals from different backgrounds, fostering collaboration and understanding.

As of now, I am actively pursuing my second software internship, which has further fueled my passion for the field. I find the software industry incredibly captivating due to its dynamic nature and its potential to drive transformative change. Through this internship, I aim to enhance my skills, gain practical experience, and contribute to impactful projects.

Within this portfolio, you will find a collection of my notable projects, experiences, and accomplishments. They serve as a testament to my abilities and dedication. As you explore my work, I hope to showcase my passion, creativity, and proficiency in the software industry.
